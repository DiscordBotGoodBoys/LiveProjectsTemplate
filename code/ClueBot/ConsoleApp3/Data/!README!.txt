###	SETTING UP THE .JSON FILE	###

1)	Copy "SettingsDefault.json" and rename it to "Settings.json". If you cannot see file name extensions, go to View and check "File name extensions".

2)	Open "Settings.json" with your preferred text editor.

3)	Replace the "bot_token" with your bot's token and "owner_ID" with your Discord ID.

3a)	To find your bot's token, go to "https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/", go to "Bot" and click "Click to Reveal Token". Note that this is NOT 
	your "Client Secret". Remember to never share your bot's token!
	
3b)	To find your own ID, right click your name in any server and click Copy ID.

3c) 	"log": doesn't need to be changed.

4)	To invite your bot, go to "https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0". Replace CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE with
	your bot's Client_ID, found on "https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/".

5) 	You're all set! Run the code and your bot should come online.
