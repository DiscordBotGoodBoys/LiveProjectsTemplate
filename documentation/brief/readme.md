# Brief

Discord is a rapidly growing chat service (and now storefront) aimed specifically at gamers. It's so popular, we even have an official university server for our Games courses!

One way in which functionality can be added to, or customised on, Discord servers is for users to write 'bots' which automatically respond to commands, and provide extra functionality.  Some examples of bots which are particularly useful include bots which allow chatters to post polls, roll random numbers, or retrieve statistics from particular games. You can see some examples of existing Discord bots at: https://discordbots.org/

Your task for this project is to scope out and identify a useful bot that doesn't currently exist (or, at least, for which there is no suitable bot) and implement the bot.  You will need to carry out appropriate testing and implementation.

Discord offers bot libraries for JavaScript, Java, Python and C#, so there's a wide choice of implementation languages, and bots can be hosted freely/cheaply on a Raspberry Pi, or a free Amazon Web Services account.
